# Expert system in Python in 5 minutes by Hubert Piotrowski

Python is known for many of its features, no doubts abopt that for sure. What is actually the most powerful feature or better though - the main key feature of any language itself to me is the fact that we can write 3rd party modules which talk to another languages or to some 3rd party frameworks. 

## Final note

Of course I am fully aware of the fact that pyCLIPS project is not being updated since 2008. This is not the main point in that article. I just wanted to show how to use C module for Python with external laguage and its semi-engine (something like LISP) which allows you to write much simpler and cleaner code for expert systems.
