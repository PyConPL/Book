**The Secret Arts of Successfully Teaching Coding to the Next Generation**
**Abstract**
Computer Science is now regarded as one of the leading disciplines in the 21st century. Computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most, if not all, sectors of our modern society – applications include using them in weather forecasting, robotic surgery, space exploration, e-commerce, smart cities, driverless cars, etc.

Therefore, coding or computer programming is now regarded by many as an essential skill for the young person, and it has been dubbed the ‘4th’ R’ (computer pRogramming) along with Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic.

In recognition of the new status of computer programming, governments worldwide have launched initiatives to have it taught in schools from Kindergarten through to junior school and all the way through secondary school.

So, the question emerges is how do we best teach and motivate the next generation in acquiring this skill? Given the fact that this field is very much in its infancy, there are insufficient number of skilled Computer Science teachers and  very little pedagogy to guide the educator. Therefore, the whole world is learning how best to teach this subject by trial and error.

The talk will describe a case study whereby coding/computer programming, in the form of Python programming, was introduced to a group of 110 young people from the ages of 11 to 18 (Years 7-13 in a U.K secondary school). The talk will include descriptions of the various teaching methodologies introduced to the young people for this purpose and the outcomes; the talk will also address various challenges and questions about how to teach coding to young people. The talk will conclude with helpful suggestions, based on the findings of the case study, on how to proceed with the teaching of computer programming to these people. 
 
          **Introduction:**
Having joyfully accepted the position as Head of Department of Computer Science in an independent secondary school in the UK, I immediately began to think of the heavy challenges that lay ahead. I would be acting as a one-person band single-handedly teaching all years groups from 7 to 13 (students aged 11-18, total number of students being 110) in this newly introduced subject to school students not only in this particular school, but also in the nation and in the world. 

There have been various writings about the challenges involved in teaching Computer Science in this day and age. ”The subject is so young that teachers and curriculum designers have little pedagogical research to guide them”, writes the Economist (Ref. 1)

And Indian-born CEO of the global giant Microsoft, Sadya Nadell, recently said in an interview that: "the fact that most curricula in schools still don't recognise computer science like they do maths or physics is just crazy" (Ref 2). 

However, with the belief that these problems are not insurmountable and can indeed be tackled very successfully, I forged ahead with devising a successful plan of action. With so little pedagogy the decision was made to devise one’s own plan. Described below are the Questions poised in my mind and the resulting Answers: (there are 8 Questions).


**Q1. How can we persuade students that Computer Science is a subject worth studying? And how can it compete against other more established subjects?**

This venture was approached in the spirit of an entrepreneur starting his/her own business. An entrepreneur requires a business plan with a vision, objectives, methodology, unique selling points (USPs) and in turn this venture also requires all of this. 

With regards to the Unique Selling Points, the 1st USP would be that the financial rewards for studying Computer Science can be enormous and it should be noted that the of the top 10 richest people in the world over half of them are involved in technology with the top 3 richest people in the world (the billionaires) being Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (Ref. 4). 

The 2nd USP is that computers are ubiquitous and prevalent in most/all aspects of life from driverless cars, robotic surgery in medicine, space research, commercial enterprises in Amazon, etc. Indeed,  “if computers hadn’t been invented, science would have ground to a halt in the 2nd half of the 20th century “. (Ref. 3)

The 3rd USP is major role technology plays in the world economy.“The market capitalization of the FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet (parent of Google)) is bigger than the economy of some countries. So great is the worth of just the three largest FANGs that if they were countries each would be eligible for membership of the G20, a club of the world’s richest nations.” (Ref. 5)






**Q2. How should we start teaching school children Computer Programming? How should we pitch the lessons to Year 7 students (these students are aged 11 and 12) – those at the start of their secondary school career? In particular should we be using drag-and-drop languages such as Scratch as a first teaching language?**

To find answers to these questions, a study was made of what the young students learn in other subjects at this age. Note was taken of the facts that it is not unusual for these students to:-
(i)	Study Shakespeare’s plays such as “Mid-Summer Night’s Dream”.
(ii)	Analyse poetry 
(iii)	Being set essays on the advantages and disadvantages of Brexit! 
(iv)	Solve simultaneous equations. 

From this information, we surmised that young people at this stage are comfortable with being able to manipulate symbols and deal with sophisticated text, and therefore concluded that they should be able to cope well with a textual computer programming language, such as Python, as a 1st
programming language. 


**Q3. What programming language should be taught as a 1st language?**

A decision was made to teach a computer programming language which is in demand by the employers of today and out of the dozen choices, the decision was made to teach computer programming through the Python language.  The justification for the decision was that:
	At the time of writing Python is the most widely used teaching language worldwide in schools and universities; 
	Python is also the No. 1 commercial language used by the likes of Google, etc.
	There is a plethora of resources and many books are being written on the subject. This means the language has a strong support network.
	The language is itself under rapid development with new libraries being released into the public domain at a regular pace.


**Q4. How do we interpret the National Curriculum?**

After a great deal of soul-searching, it was decided that the UK national curriculum in this subject, although laudable in its intentions, would be used as one of a number of guides as with regards to how and what should be taught; but, the UK National Curriculum would not to be treated as the definitive authority on the subject of teaching Computer Science in the schools.



**Q5. What do we do about obtaining resources such as textbooks?**
A decision was made to equip all students with a textbook and exercise book as note was taken of the fact that most serious academic subject have both textbooks and exercise books associated with them. Unfortunately, no appropriate textbooks were available for the subject for Years 7-9. So, Worksheets, Youtube videos (60 videos in total), Websites were all constructed to develop the resource base to be used by the students.


**Q6. How shall we introduce the concept of Computer Programming?**

A decision was made to employ a bottom-up approach to teach Computer Programming. This is a tried, tested, successful and traditional method used in the teaching of Computer Programming to adults. Foreign languages and mathematics has also been taught in this manner traditionally. 

However, there was some trepidation as to whether the UK students would be accepting of this bottom-up approach as the modern trend in UK schools is to employ top-down approaches whilst teaching subjects. It was felt that in order for this bottom-up approach to work we would need  explicit “buy-in” from the students as they are relatively unaccustomed to this, therefore we would need to provide an explanation of why this approach was going to be used prior to any teaching.

The explanation provided to the students began with the fact that Computer Programming languages, having a built-in grammar, can be thought of as analogous to human languages, and just as human beings can communicate with each other in different human languages such as English, Polish, Chinese, we communicate with computers in Computer Programming languages of which there are many and we will be using Python. Then an explanation was provided that programs were analogous to essays; programming statements were analogous to sentences; keywords in programs were analogous to words. We would therefore be learning about a keyword at a time and learn about its uses before building up in due course to create more complex programs. The students appeared to like this explanation and buy in to the bottom-up concept. From time to time, I was asked by the students questions such as: “are you fluent in Python language?” Indeed, parents in parents evening mentioned how much their children were enjoying and loving the subject.



**Q7. What is the outcome of our approach?**
This bottom-up, teacher-led approach to teach computer programming appealed tremendously to the younger generation of students and their parents. 
Below are some examples of programs written on a white-board by some Year 7 students.
  
`def Addition_two_numbers(number1,number2)`
                `total = number1+number2`
                 `return(total)`
`Addition(10,12)`

`# Nested Loop`
`for floors in range(1,6):`
      `for rooms in range(1,5)`
              `print(floors, rooms`


These writings below have been produced by Year 7 students (aged 11 and 12) in response to an examination question “Computer Science is said to be one of the most important subjects that a young person needs to learn about. Why do you think it is important to study Computer Science?”

**STUDENTS’ RESPONSES**
**Response 1**
_“The technological advances of the modern age have been spectacular, from simple things like apple watches, to the more advanced Artificial Intelligence robots. With these changes comes a great responsibility for us, as the future generation, to understand this science so that we can continue to innovate and create.
We must understand the inner workings of machines and to question everything around us, in order to build on the foundations that our elders have laid down for us.
When I was younger, I used to believe that robots would someday rule the world. In some sense, I still believe that, because if we can build a chess playing AI robot, who knows what else humankind can come up with. We must continue the legacy of computer science.
More and more companies are beginning to use technology in place of humans, and although this closes up some jobs, it opens up so many more. They need people to understand, to look after, check this technology in case something goes wrong. We CAN be those people. The future is us, the young people. We can make a difference. The future starts NOW.”_

**Response 2**
_“I think it is vital to study Computer Science since as we are growing up, technology is expanding and is becoming an essential part of our everyday lives.
Nearly all of the most famous and successful billionaires have made their fortune from making programs which have become used everywhere and so we now too have a chance to become as rich and successful as them.”_

**Response 3**
_I believe that it is important to study Computer Science as a young person. This is because Computer Science challenges the human brain and pushes our thinking to its peak so that we can solve complex problems. It strengthens our minds and enables us to solve problems in life much quicker and straightforward ease. 
Our society is based on the modern era of technology and artificial advancement and so to perceive and understand our surroundings, we must learn great necessities such as Computer Science.
Finally, to develop society and our world and technology, young people are the main source behind it. So to learn Computer Science and potentially change the world with technology and advancements, we are learning one of the most important subjects yet._

**Response 4**
_I think it is important because computers are the future and it is really important we know how to use them.  Also, it is used in almost all jobs now and you can become rich and famous because of computing. Finally, it is extremely interesting and exciting to learn and will help people lots in the future._ 

A casual observer reading these writings commented:-
“the problem is that the ambitions, aspirations and vision of these young students far outweighs and outstrips those of their teachers.”


**Q8. What conclusions can we infer from this approach?**

In this particular case of, my teaching for the first time in this school, I found:-

1)	The Year 7 students found Computer Programming easier than the Year 8 who found it easier than Year 9 who found it easier than Year 10 and who found it easier than Year 11 – starting properly from the beginning is better.
2)	Points need to be properly explained. The students felt happier with this teacher-led approach rather than student-led approach or independent learning, at this beginning stage.
3)	Terminology should be introduced along the way and hang on to examples and operations.
4)	Crying need for decent textbooks and resources fit for purpose.
5)	The best students were the ones who are motivated to do well in the subject.

I like to conclude that:-
Computer Science, it is the subject for the 21st century.  It embraces all human activities from futuristic space travels to unravelling the DNA information of life, smart phones, financial and government transactions and what not. The main point is that this knowledge has to be transmitted accurately by motivating the students and the educational policy makers. The practitioners of this exciting technology should be able to package this complex interesting knowledge into an utility package for even the riff-raffs as it is being done for various applications like the mobile phones – they do not have to know the principles of maths, relativity, quantum mechanics or SIM architecture.
