# Caution! May Contain: student solutions, ~~IoT~~ and project management.

## Hi.

I would **very** much like to share some of the experiences I have witnessed during my college years. They will revolve only around team projects -- projects I had the (mis)fortune of managing in one way or another.

## Motivation not provided
While most of the PyCon attendees would be quite enthusiastic about participating in a project as opposed to sleeping on lectures, the school world is not as easy to tame.

### Monay
It's hard enough to get unmotivated people to work on a project that provides remuneration. Now imagine how hard it is to get them to work on an only a vague mention of possible in-the-future kickbacks from a project. This gets _molto_ more difficult once you start talking with actually useful students, that could use their time in a freelance project and get compensation for it.

There should always be something you can give back to the team. Once they feel rewarded, they find the will to pursue the tasks and finish them. In our case, we gave the contributors some of the spare parts -- project wouldn't have any use of them, but they could have some fun with them.

### Tiem
Many of the students consider college to be the last point in their lives which provides them with actual worry-free free time. Why implement a functionality, when I could be playing my xbox right now? Should I start installing those devices this weekend or go for a concert? Once you're talking entertainment vs free work, choice is often obvious.

Once lack-of-time-problem has arisen, we have given them the tools to work at home. Soon enough,  they found themselves curious enough of the toys on their desks that the tasks came back finished far sooner than we would've expected.

As it was a student environment, we could play around with lectures. We have used the entire last semester and some part of second to last semester as part of the project. Software engineering, software testing, group projects - every single one of those lectures was used with the base being our ongoing project. This helped the student to save time and earn better grades.

### Wantn't
And the saddest problem to be observed is that people simply don't want to **do it**! These people can be still swayed in your favor, but there exist also the worst cases: people that don't want to do **any**thing.

Orbiting around the project were the final papers of our studies, the theses. They were also focused on the project we were involved in, thus writing the theses and creation of documentation was the same action. And it's not like anyone could skip their thesis, so the *want* interlapped with the *need*. And the need of the project became the need of the student.

## Delivery not guaranteed
Unfortunately, most of the projects do not bring anything with them. That is, students stressed for time and often way in over their heads will struggle to deliver something of value -- focusing on getting it good enough for a passing grade, never looking upon it again. Never even considering it as a part of portfolio!

### Ain't doing it for 'em
You might struggle with people refusing to help the weaker participants -- *I am not going to do it, it's their job!* Sometimes you might have a problem with identifying that someone is actually not doing their job at all -- *Ain't a snitch, now am I?*

This is where the Scrum's tools come in. Organize stand-ups and retrospectives. Use ticket approach and have a physical board readily available. You will be able to identify the bottlenecks and throttling points.

Having identified the weak and the unhelpful, don't be afraid to take action. You should help them. You should negotiate.

**You should _not_ be afraid to remove people from the project** -- there's no impact on their livelihood, so you won't be responsible for their poverty because of an action like that.

We actually were forced to witness a contest between two developers that did not provide anything but frustration. In the end I had to redo the code myself with limited time and motivation.

We also had a couple of members who did not delivered anything for a variety of reasons. Thus we removed them from the project and went on.

### Ain't doing it well
Two kinds of people may deliver solutions that are plain bad. You will have to identify whether it's malice or incompetence -- and that is not often obvious. People are very often afraid to accept their incompetence as an existing state that is not inherently bad -- especially in college: you're still learning, damn you!

Others may just want to see your initiative burn for *whatever* reason. Perhaps they don't like IT, maybe they don't like Python;  for all you know they might hate **you** in particular!

### Ain't doing it at all
Keeping with the sad end theme, there are people who will just refuse to do anything at all. And there might be some singular cases where they'll tell you *nay!*, but most often you will struggle to try and explain and fix their problems and motivate them, but in the end you will find that are simply not interested in the slightest.

## Satisfaction TBD
Having an unmotivated team, that doesn't care much about delivery, how can we say anything about satisfaction? However, when they do deliver, they can be the happiest bunch.

You might need to actually _teach_ your team to take pride in their work. Unteach them the grade-based motivations and the just-let-me-pass techniques. That's not as easy as it sounds. You might often witness in your work environments that there exist people who will either do stuff _passably_ well ("a passing grade is enough") or will constantly vie for attention ("I need to have the best grade in class"). This often will show you that the person was not properly untaught that business is not a school.

## Internet of Things is the way to go
Working with students, you will mostly likely want to teach them something. The time being limited as it is, you will be inclined to defer it to their own private time -- you have to pique some interest in their heads.

### Small
It's tiny, ok? Anyone can fit it in their home. Whether it be a weather station or a dust sensor, it will fit. They can carry it around. You can keep in the lecture room's closet.

This teaches how to handle electronics, how to preserve it and protect it, what not to do with it. Engineer's way of thought easily activates.

### Easy
Everything is already done. All they have to do is connect the pieces. But in that connecting, they will see the code, the structure, the dependencies. Perhaps they may fix something. They will often be inclined to try and  *make it better*.

This teaches how software looks like, how to deal with various constraints - language, memory - without the hassle of spending multitude of hours on a solution.

### Moddable
Having and Arduino or Raspberry or Orange or whatever else there is, you might add anything onto it. You will soon see your "workers" delivering much more than you bargained for.  Out of a sensor station, you will receive a whole weather machine; out of a monitoring mini-computer, entire room controller. You can do anything and it's incredibly rewarding.

### Affordable
To top it all off, it's cheap. This is a good thing for both project management and the project members. PMs may easily fit into tight budgets and developers can always spend something of their own to experiment and don't feel a great dent in their budgets.


IoT with students can be great fun!
