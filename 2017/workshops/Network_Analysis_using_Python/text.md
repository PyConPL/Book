# Network Analysis using Python
Politics, Mathematics, Law, Biology, Computer Science, Finance all of these subjects have one thing in common.
They can be modeled using networks. NetworkX is a Python language software package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
This workshop will introduce the basics of network theory and working with graphs using python and the NetworkX package.
This will be a hands on tutorial and will require writing a lot of code snippets.
The participants should be comfortable with basic python (loops, dictionaries, lists) and some(minimal) experience with working inside a jupyter notebook.


##
Broadly the tutorial is divided into four parts:

Part A
- Basics of graph theory and various examples of networks in real life.
- Introduction to the NetworkX API and various data structures


Part B
- Work with small synthetic networks (generated using random graph generators) to understand the structure of the network.
- Analyse the network and study various properties of the network like centrality, connectivity, shortest paths, cliques.


Part C
- We'll use the various techniques we have learnt so far and model a network out of real world data like co-authorship network( http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/cond-mat-2005.zip) or a similar network and study the structure and properties of this network.


Part D
- We'll work on some interesting problems like temporal networks and visualisation of networks.
- We'll model the US Airport Network with respect to time and will try to make sense out of it.


By the end of the tutorial everyone should be comfortable with hacking on the NetworkX API, modelling data as networks and basic analysis on networks using python.

This text gives a brief overview of the content of the workshop.

### Packages and other requirements

You should have python3 and pip installed, and using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is recommended and the following python packages should be installed.
- jupyter
- matplotlib
- networkx
- pandas
- numpy

You can also use [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to install these packages.

The workshop will also require datasets to work on which will be uploaded on github repository https://github.com/MridulS/pyconpl-2017-networkx.

The repo will contain the jupyter notebooks that will be required during the workshop.

## Introduction

##### What are Networks (Graphs) and how can we use NetworkX and Python to represent them?

A graph G is represented by a set of nodes and a set of edges. An edge between two nodes in a graph signifies a relationship between those two nodes. Edges can be directed and undirected.

NetworkX uses dictionaries underneath to store node and edge data. It's dict-o-dict-o-dict-o-dict to be precise.
```
G['node1']
G['node1']['node2']
G['node1']['node2']['some_id']['some_attrb'] # multigraphs
```

##### Basics of NetworkX

There are multiple graph classes implemented in NetworkX.
- Graph: A graph object which only allows single edges (undirected) between nodes.
- DiGraph: A graph object which only allow single edges (directed) betweeen nodes, i.e. an edge from 'A' to 'B' doesn't mean that there exists an edge from 'B' to 'A'.
- MultiGraph: A graph object which allows multiple edges(undirected) between two edges.
- MultiDiGraph: A graph object which allows multiple edges(directed) between two edges.

Hybrid graphs? Not yet available in NetworkX.

``` python
# Create an empty graph object with no nodes and edges.
G = nx.Graph() # DiGraph, MultiGraph, MultiDiGraph
```

``` python
# Add nodes to our graph object
# In NetworkX, nodes can be any hashable object e.g. a text string, an image,
# an XML object, another Graph, a customized node object, etc.

G.add_node('1')
G.add_node(1)
G.add_node('second')
```

`G.nodes()` will give a list of nodes.

``` python
# Now let's talk about edges.
# Edge between two nodes means that they share some property/relationship
# G.add_node(H)
G.add_edge(0, 'second')
G.add_edge(2, 3)
G.add_edge('second', 'node4')
```
`G.edges()` will give a list of edges.

##### Measures and properties of a network

Finding the important nodes in a network is a task frequently encountered by network scientists.
There are various approaches to this like using the nodes with highest degree, i.e connections. or nodes which have a high number of paths going through them as removing that node can impair mobility in the network.
Deciding the measures to use depends on the applications and the requirements of the network scientist.

Usually one of the most important tasks in network analysis is to find the shortest path and there are various algorithm to dot that.
We will use the algorithms implemented in the NetworkX package to study the network.

Structures in a network is also a major network analysis tool like finding triangles, cliques, open triangles. A rudimentary recommendation engine can be made by
looking for open triangles in a network.

From wikipedia,
A connected component (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph.

NetworkX has algorithms implemented to help us with finding components of a network.
``` python
print [len(c) for c in sorted(nx.connected_components(authors_graph), key=len, reverse=True)]
```
This piece of code gives us the components of a network `authors_graph` where `authors_graph` is the Arxiv GR-QC (General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology) collaboration network.

```

As we can see from the output there are a lot of authors who work in pairs (they haven't collaborated with anyone other than their partner) and triangles.
But the majority, 4158, work in a big collabration network, even though we have a lone wolf there.

We can find many other interesting properties of a dataset by doing exploratory analysis of the network.

##### Real world data

There are multiple sources to find real word network datasets like [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) and [KONECT](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de).
We will use a real world network and analyse the network using the various tools and measures we learn in this tutorial.
