## ABSTRACT
ZODB is an object-oriented database written in Python and 
optimized in C.   It is widely used in the US, but not as well 
known in Poland.  This talk introduces the database, 
presents important concepts, and reviews the tools available.

## About the Author
Christopher Lozinski has been using the ZODB since 1999.  
He is an MIT graduate and silicon valley expat who has 
been using dynamically bound 
languages for 35 years.  First it was Lisp, then Objective-C, 
and now Python.  On the ZODB, he built  PythonLinks.info, PolandTrade.info, 
PrivaCV.com, Zopache.com, and the recently decommissioned 
SpecialtyJobMarkets.com.  He is a dual Polish-US citizen, and polyglot.

## INTRODUCTION

You can see the talk slides here: 
https://pythonlinks.info/presentations/zodbtalk.pdf

ZODB is an object-oriented databaase written in Python and 
optimized in C. This article is a good representation of the talk
I am giving at Pycon Poland 2017.

## So Easy to use

ZODB is really easy to use.  Just subclass off of class persistent.Persistent,
and your objects become persistent.  Here is a code sample from the Tutorial.
http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/tutorial.html

```
import persistent

class Account(persistent.Persistent):

def __init__(self):
￼   ￼self.balance = 0.0
￼￼
def deposit(self, amount):
    self.balance += amount

def cash(self, amount):
    assert amount < self.balance
    self.balance -= amount

```

Did you notice how trivial it was to create a persistent object. Magic!

You can also subclass off of class Persitent Containers (Btrees), and 
class Persistent Set.

## ACID Properties

ZODB is an ACID-compliant database. 

### Atomicity
Atomicity requires that each transaction be "all or nothing".

### Consistency 
Consistency  ensures that any transaction will bring the database 
from one valid state to another. 

### Isolation
Isolation ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions 
results in a system state that would be obtained if 
transactions were executed sequentially, i.e., one after the other.

### Durability
Durability 
Durability  ensures that once a transaction 
has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. 

## ZODB Data Model

Simple ZODB applications store data as a tree of objects. essentially a 
tree of dictionaries.  More sophisticated
applications store Data as a graph of objects.  Really sophisticated 
applications can store data as any Python data structure.  If the data is 
reachable from the root object it is persistent.  If not, it is garbage 
collected.  

## A Specific Data Model

PythonLinks.info/the-world is a model of the Python software industry 
represented as a hierarchy.  "The-world" is a category containing regions. 
Regions contain countries.  Countries contain cities. Cities contain 
companies.  Companies can contain jobs, products, and other links such as 
YouTube videos, product reviews, and blogs.  The tree representing the 
Python industry can be displayed as a table.  

## Traversal
To access a particular object, one has to start at the root, and traverse 
the tree.  Since the nodes are essentially dictionaries, with text keys, it
is very natural to map a URL to a particular object by traversing the tree. 


## Canonical URL's
ZODB applications access objects by traversing the tree.  It would be nice 
if every object had its own unique name, so that even when the tree 
structure changed, it would still be easy to 
find the object using its canonical URL. 
 
PythonLinks provides canoninc urls. .  Every node has a unique name which can 
be accessed using a dictionary in the root node.   
Atempts to create a new node with the same name, result in an integer 
being appended to the new node name. Node, Node-1, Node-2, etc. 
When objects are renamed, or deleted, the root dictiionary is updated.  

## ZODB History and Undo
ZODB is a versioned database.  Each object preserves its historical versions 
until they are garbage collected.   That makes 
it possible to edit an object, save the edits, and then revert to the 
previous version of the object.  One can even do diffs of previous objects, 
in order to decide which one is best.

## ZODB Storage Options

There is a rich variety of ways to store your ZODB objects. 

1. **FileStorage** is the basic way of storing ZODB (Python) objects on the 
file system.  There is also Blob storage for storing images, files and other 
large objects on the file system. 
2. **ZEO** is the basic client server version of the ZODB.  
ZEO clients share data from the ZEO server.
Each participating Python application 
server includes a ZEO client.  They all talk to the ZEO server. The ZEO server
will then store the data in FileStorage and BlobStorage 
3. **RelStorage**  stores ZODB data in a relational database. It performs 
better than ZEO. It runs on top of MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL.
4. **NewtDB** is a version of RelStorage optimized for PostgreSQL.  It stores
data as both Python pickles, as well as JSONB Postgres data structures.  This 
allows one to benefit from the native PostgreSQL catalogs.


## Caching
Caching is an important feature of the ZODB. Every ZEO client includes an 
object cache. The object cache is usually in RAM.  THere is an optional 
file based cache.  If objects are updated on one ZEO client, they are 
invalidated on the other clients, and reloaded as needed.  Generally this 
works fine, but in cases where the object is actively used on all ZEO 
clients, and frequently updated, it does lead to more network traffic. 

## Scalability
For mostly-read applications ZODB scales brilliantly. 
Multiple disk heads can read simultanwously from different parts of the file 
used in FileStorage. Historically its 
performance under heavy writing was limited because writes all happened at 
the end of  a single file.  Only one disk head at a time could write.  That 
problem has now been fixed.  Writes can now occur simultaneously on 
multiple files on a single computer.  The database can grow even larger by 
hosting the blobs on remote servers, such as Amazon S3. 

At Zope Corporation, several hundred newspaper content-management systems and web sites were hosted using a multi-database configuration with most data in a main database and a catalog database. The databases had several hundred gigabytes of ordinary database records plus multiple terabytes of blob data.

Of course if you need multiple computers to store your object data (not blobs),
then you may want to upgrade to NEO (Not NEO4J). NEO is a GPL'd 
cousin to the ZODB. 

## ZODB Tutorial
ZODB is really easy to use from Python.  I invite you to try out the 
Tutorial:  http://www.zodb.org/en/latest/tutorial.html

## Multiple Views on Every Object
The modern way to use a ZODB data model on the web is to support views on 
objects.  There can be multiple views on any object.  There can be the same 
view on different objects.  That same view can be one class, or else using 
the Zope Component Architecture, there can be different views with the 
same name on different classes of objects, depending on the interfaces
which they ahve defined. 

## ZODB-related Platforms

So which platform should you use with ZODB?  
I am not an expert in all of these platforms, but I will give you my best 
advice on when to use each of them. 

### Plone
If you need a Content Management System, and Plone and its plugins do what 
you need.  Brilliant.  Go for it.  Plone is mature, stable, heavily used. 
They have an annual international conference, and many regional conferences.  
I recommend it highly. There are lots of consultants you can hire. 

But Plone is not an application development platform.  If Plone does what 
you need, you are in great luck.  But I advise against making changes to
Plone.  Small changes you may be able to make, but anything more major, 
and you 
are more likely than not to run into trouble.  There is just so much code
in there.  Zope 2 code, Zope 3 code, and Five (a merger of 
Zope 2 and Zope 3).  Then there is the Content Management Framework (CMF), and 
all of Plone. Way way too complex to even consider doing custom app 
development on it. 

### Pyramid
The next obvious choice is Pyramid.  If you are building a corporate 
application, Pyramid is a great option.  You can use the ZODB, or a
relational database.  You can use routing or traversal. You can configure 
it three different ways.  You 
can choose from lots of different GUI and other libraries.  


### Grok
Me,   I chose to use Grok with Zope 3.  I am not building a corporate
application.  I am building startup applications.  I don't care about 
computer performance, if my applications are overloaded, that is a great 
problem to have. I can then optimize things. Above all else, 
I care about speed and cost of development.  Related to that is software flexiility. 


### Zopache

Sadly Grok lacks a TTW development environment, so I built one. 
Zopache.com is a Javascript IDE 
which I bult on top of the ZODB using Grok. ZODB 
developers might call it a TTW development platform. 

Basic Zopache objects include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python Scripts, 
Image, File and Jade.  
HTML objects can be edited with either the WYSIWYG HTML editor, or the 
technical Ace Editor.  CSS Javascript and Python Scripts can 
also be edited with the Ace Editor.

Zopache also supports containers.  Trees can be built out of containers. 
Folders support cut, copy, rename paste and delete operations. HTML folders
can be edited with the Ace and ck editors.  Javascript Folders allow one to 
build a well organized  tree of Javascript code, but serve it as a single 
minified file or as a human readable and searchable file, wich clickable links to 
the original javascript object. History and Undo are supported.  

Using Zopache, in your browser, you create a tree of 
folders, and populate and edit those objects.    
Every object has its own URL, and can be 
displayed or edited. These is no need to know Unix.  But you do have the 
option to grow the application with real Python code. 

### Flask
Flask is a very lightweight framework which can be used with the ZODB.
Flask does routing, so one has to manually map 
from URL's to objects.  

### Other Frameworks. 
There are many Python frameworks, and many other less often 
used ways of working with the ZODB.  I won't 
mention them all here.  They lead to market confusion.  But 
it is only natural in the Python world for there to be 
many different solutions. So one really needs a survey of the 
ZODB ecosystem to get you started in the right direction. 


## Pyramid Vs Grok
So let us compare them. Of course Grok can be used in different ways, 
so I will focus on how I use it. 

Pyramid
is very focussed on computer performance, how fast will the software 
run?  I am focussed on developer 
performance, how fast can I develop my applications.  They want close to the
metal code.  I want high levels of abstractions.  

In particular the Pyramid folks are mosty strongly against TTW development. 
I invite you to take a look at the quote on the SubstanceD 
demo page. 
http://demo.substanced.net/
Clearly they are very conflicted about minimal TTW development, 
let alone the idea of building a full Javascript IDE on top of the ZODB.

The next issue is the target market.  Pyramid is firmly focussed on the 
consulting market.  Every client is different and needs a different solution. 
They want the ability to 
do it this way or that way. Use a relational database or the ZODB.  Use 
dispatch or traversal. Configure it three different ways. There are multiple
ways to do things. 

I am more focussed on the product market.  There is no legacy code here. 
Just the web, which I have to work with. 
I want to build it as fast and flexibly as is possible. 
I like the Python idea that there should be one 
way to do thigns.  
I want a purist OO approach.  
Like Ruby on Rails, I want an 
opinionated high level framework.  Grok gives me that. 

Pyramid is focussed on multiple deployments.  So TTW makes no sense.  
I am focussed on building a single website, so storing 
stuff in the ZODB is much more modern than storing it on a 40 year old 
filesystem. 
￼￼￼
But let us do a closer technical comparison. 
Actually I am not even sure what to compare.  For
a fair comparison, Pyramid does not stand on its own. It needs a bunch of 
libraries to match what Grok does.  

The first  thing I want to do is automatic CRUD.  Define the schema and 
get CRUD 
for free.  zope.formlib does this for me.  z3c.form does this for me for 
trees. Pyramid does not include  CRUD. 
One has to add it manually. I am still not 
sure which CRUD package to recommend.  Reportedly the one used in SubstanceD 
does not do CRUD.  So which one does?  The next one I found has just been 
re-architectedd for use with relational databases.  Also not what I need. 



I also use components.  Pyramid only supports view components.  
But the Zope Component Architecture is now available with PyAMS.  
That was not true when I started. 

And of course there is no way that 
somethng like the high level zope.securitypolicy has been ported to Pyramid. 
It is just imconpatible with the performace-optimized Pyramid security model. 

## Other Databases
There are many other NoSQL databases on the market.  My job is 
not to evaluate them all, but just to get you to ask the right
questions. 

1. Is it ACID complient?
2. Do they provide a graph database?
3. Do they support Persistent Python?
4. Can you add arbitrary  instance variables at run-time?
4. Do they support history and undo?

## About PythonLinks.info
PythonLinks.info is the world's largest Python Directory.  One branch
includes a geographic directory of companies using Python.  For each 
region, for each country for each city, Python Links lists the companies 
in that city, and provides important links for that company.  Their name is 
hyperlinked to their web site.  Their products and jos are listed. It is also
possible to add You Tube videos, blogs, product reviews, and reviews of what 
it is like to work at the company. 

This directory is all in Javascript, and json, so it is 
quite easy to add teh table of companies in your city to your website.  Let 
me know if you are interested in doing so.
