Form and size:
---
  * Article should contain short abstract at the beginning (4-6 sentences recommended).
  * Main part of the article can have various forms, depending on what author will find the most suitable,
  for example it can be strictly aligned with what he wants to pass to attendees during the talk/workshop or it can be
  a supplement of the topic. Also it can contain elements that don't present well or are to fit on slides - for example
  bigger chunks of code.
  * Article should contain between 800 and 2500 words. In case of longer articles we reserve the right to cut some
  less important parts (with author's agreement).
  * At the end of article please provide the sources, that were used while writing the article (some where used for sure!).
  You can also recommend to reader some websites and books related to the topic.
  * In case of links more general form is prefered (address of the main website + title of source article)
  For example:
  pythonabc.eu "How to create Pong using Python"
  instead of
  pythonabc.eu/index.php?opt=com_sasd&art=243523&id=2&Itemid=13

Technical matters:
---
  * Articles should be prepared in Markdown format through PyCon PL repository. If you don't have a clue what we are writing about in previous sentence and you don't know Github etc. then contact Radomir Dopieralski (mail radomir@dopieralski.pl), he'll be happy to help.
  * Article can contain graphics (diagrams, screenshots etc.), but you should keep common sense to not overuse that. Vector graphics formats are recommended (SVG, EPS), but of course use raster ones in case of photos and screenshots (remember about appropriate image resolution in that second case).  Graphics, even if embedded in the article, should be also delivered in separate files. Book will be in grayscale (except the cover which is traditionally in color) so please keep that in mind that all your graphics should look acceptable in grayscale.
  * Article can contain code sections. Those will be printed with monospaced font.
  * All articles will be corrected but we highly recommend keeping good language quality and also using spellchecker.
